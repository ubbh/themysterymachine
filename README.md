# The Mystery Machine

MVP:
	We plan to make a First-Person Shooter in the Unity Engine where the primary feature is that player to takes control of the last enemy he shot. The player will utilize common firearms against enemies programmed with unique AI. The game will also feature a main menu and head up display. The HUD will have a damage indicator, health bar, ammo count and a game over screen. There will be at least two levels on the game (one being a jail and the other being a rooftop). The player's starting weapon will be a handgun, however you will be able to walk over weapon drops and change weapons. Ammo and reloading will also be properties of the weapons. It will also feature sounds such as shooting and game over noises.

Possible additions:

	-Larger variety of weapons.
	
	-Larger variety of enemies.

	-Greater number of levels, both larger and more complicated.

	-Custom models for weaponry, characters.

	-Story elements.
	
	-The game will also have a scoring feature.  
	
	-Save option
	
	-Music for different situations.

User Story:

 As the user I am looking to be entertained. The game I play should be somewhat challenging yet not overwhelming. All mechanics
 should be easy to understand. Menus should be unobtrusive. Ultimately the game should be fun to play. I am able to shoot at the enemy and possess their bodies after I eliminate them. 
 
 Running the game: Download everything in Runnable folder, extract all the files into a folder, and run v0.2.0.exe
