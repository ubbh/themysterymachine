  <h1>404 Error!</h1>
  <h3>
    The HTTP 404, 404 Not Found and 404 (pronounced "four oh four") error message
     is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard response code, in computer network
     communications, to indicate that the client was able to communicate with a given server,
     but the server could not find what was requested. The web site hosting server will typically
    generate a "404 Not Found" web page when a user attempts to follow a broken or dead link;
    hence the 404 error is one of the most recognizable errors encountered on the World Wide Web.
